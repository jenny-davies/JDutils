A collection of useful functions for small but frequent tasks.

## Functions

`create_filename`: given an export location and filename, check if there are any existing files with the same name in the same location and append a suffix to the end of the filename to avoid overwriting existing files.

`generate_temporary_name`: generate a random string after "temp\_".

`get_financial_year`: derive the financial year from a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

`run_and_capture_message`: run a chunk of code and capture any messages created into a new variable.
